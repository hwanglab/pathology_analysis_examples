Exercise:
let us use the example slide: TCGA-BL-A3JM-01Z-00-DX1.33E53972-CEA4-4D84-A5D2-7DAD7B0C27F8.svs'

Tasks:
Given the example slide,
(1) divide tissue regions into 512x512 um non-overalapping image patches
(2) using threshold + marker-controlled watershed algorithm to segment cell nuclei in all patches
(3) computer all cell nuclei properties, e.g., area, perimeter, and plot histogram figures for one or two your computed nuclei properties

Your can freely implement your programs based on your idea. The purpose here is only for practicing pathology image processing
