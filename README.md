# In this project, I will make some simple examples to show how to process pathology slides using python
## Preliminary skills or knowledge: 

(1) you need have some experience in python programming

(2) you need install python toolboxes by yourself

(3) knowledge about image processing would help you understand much easier

if you have questions, please contact: Hongming Xu, mxu@ualberta.ca

Note that you should download the .svs slide from the below tcga web link:
